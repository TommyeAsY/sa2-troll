# Sonic Adventure 2 – Troll Mod

This is a gameplay mod for Sonic Adventure 2 designed to challenge player expectations in unconventional ways. While it may initially feel frustrating, the experience is intended to become enjoyable once you adapt and find creative solutions to the problems it presents.

The goal of the mod is to overplay your assumptions and expectations while staying as enjoyable a process as possible — assuming you found your solution for the new problem. The mod experience is meant to be enjoyable, but only after becoming somewhat frustrating.

Level design is primarily made for New Game, so you don't need all of the upgrades unlocked, although having them early might decrease the difficulty of the mod.

# 🔧 Installation
To install the mod:

Unzip (or currently un-rar) the contents of the archive into your Sonic Adventure 2\mods folder.

Ensure the mod files are placed inside their own separate folder.

Placing loose files directly into mods without a dedicated subfolder may cause ModLoader errors.

# 📌 Planned Development
The long-term goal is to modify all stages and bosses, though this will take time.
